## My process

- I started by putting necessary tags around text provided
- Next, I give all the elements class so as to be able to style them
- After making sure my html structure is in place, i start with the css design using the mobile first concept
- After finishing up with the mobile view i designed the desktop view
- And finally i pushed to github and hosted on vercel

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I have come to realise that the easiest designs are always the toughest to write.
I leart a whole deal with flexbox

### Continued development

Moving forward i will try to create a neat css file for all websites, for readability
